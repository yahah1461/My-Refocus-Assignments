I am Alvin Paulo Talavera, currently working as a System Administrator at HRACS Solicitor.
I love to play games and playing fetch with my dogs.

My goal this year until the first quarter of 2023 is to become a full stack web developer.
I wanted to be a web developer because, it's my dream profession.
